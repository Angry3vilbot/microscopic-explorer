When your size is 1.5x the size of the enemy cell you can attempt to eat the AI, however, if the AI cell's size is 1.5x your size it will attempt to eat you instead. The cells reappear in random locations on the screen and, as time goes on, the amount of cells gradually decreases. You win if you manage to eat the AI cell. You lose if the AI cell eats you.
